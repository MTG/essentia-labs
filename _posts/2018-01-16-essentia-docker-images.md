title: Docker images for Essentia
category: news
---

We now host images on docker hub containing Essenta, the python bindings, and all pre-built examples. This means that you can run Essentia on Linux, Mac, or Windows without having to compile it yourself.

[https://hub.docker.com/r/mtgupf/essentia/](https://hub.docker.com/r/mtgupf/essentia/)

We publish 6 variations, on three different operating systems: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 17.10, Debian 9.0 Stretch, and a python 2 and python 3 variation for each OS.

See the documentation for further information on how to run an example or python file using these images.

These images can also be used as a base image for your own docker projects if you want Essentia available.
