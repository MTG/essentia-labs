title: AcousticBrainz - a large-scale music analysis project using Essentia
---

We are very excited to announce the [AcousticBrainz](http://acousticbrainz.org/), a new collaboration project between [MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) community and the [Music Technology Group](http://mtg.upf.edu), that uses the power of music analysis done by Essentia to build a large-scale open content database of music.

The goal of the project is to crowd source acoustic information for all music in the world and to make it available to the public, providing a massive database of information about music for music technology researchers and open-source hackers. The project relies on Essentia for extracting acoustic characteristics of music, including low-level spectral information, rhythm, keys, scales, and much more, and automatic annotation by genres, moods, and instrumentation.

Since the first public announcement a month ago, the project has gained more than 1.2 million of analysed tracks. The possibility to bring audio analysis on the large scale while having all the data and tools in open access, and the instant feedback from the users, makes this project an exciting opportunity to explore the opportunities of the state-of-the-art music analysis tools and improve them. See more details about the project on the official [AcousticBrainz](http://acousticbrainz.org/) website.
