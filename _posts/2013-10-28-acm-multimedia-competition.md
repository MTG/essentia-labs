Essentia wins the Open-Source Software Competition of [ACM Multimedia 2013](http://acmmm13.org/), the worldwide premier multimedia conference that took place in Barcelona from October 21st to 25th 2013.

The [ACM Multimedia Open-Source Software Competition](http://acmmm13.org/submissions/call-for-the-open-source-software-competition/) celebrates the invaluable contribution of researchers and software developers who advance the field by providing the community with implementations of codecs, middleware, frameworks, toolkits, libraries, applications, and other multimedia software. The criteria for judging all submissions include broad applicability and potential impact, novelty, technical depth, demo suitability, and other miscellaneous factors (e.g., maturity, popularity, student-led, no dependence on closed source, etc.).
